<h2>Floor Hockey</h2>

<p> One of my hobbies include playing floor hockey with my intramural team here at the University. I joined my team during the fall semester of my freshman year and I have been playing with them ever since. Our team name is "The Mother Puckers". I play on a team with my best friend and roommate Owen and a few of our friends. Last year we came 1 game short of winning the championship and we use it as motivation to do better the next season. We will also occasionally play intramural soccer with the same group of people but my favorite intramural sport to play is floor hockey because I have always been a huge hockey fan but never learned how to skate so this was my closest alternative to playing real ice hockey.</p>
<h2> Playstation 4</h2>

<p> Another hobby of mine is to play video games with my friends back home in Massachusetts. I have a Playstation 4 in my dorm room and in my free time I like to play video games with my friends from back home. I enjoy playing video games with my friends because it is a good way of keeping up with what is going on at home and allows me to interact and have fun with my friends without having to leave my dorm room.</p>
